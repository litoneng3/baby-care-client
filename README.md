# Getting Started with Create React App

## Baby Care Website
This is my complete full stack react application. 
This is my first full stack web application.
## Objective of my website. 

1. There are number of pages in my website. 
In home page you can see navbar, header, blogs, services, testimonials, you can also see a contact form. 
In every services card there is a button buy now. when you click this button, it will take you to the login pages( if you are not a logged in user). Then you can login by google. 

2. In Dashboard page, there is a sidebar. here you will see different info whether you are an user or admin. If you are an user, you can only write review. On the other hand, if you are an admin, you can add a service or you can make someone as admin. 


For creating this website, I use html, css, bootstrap, material ui, javascript, react, react-router-dom, express, mongodb, nodejs. 

##
I deploy my server link to heroku and client side to firebase.
